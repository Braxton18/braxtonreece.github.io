						Our Mission
					</h2>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Have you ever had a parent or family member take photos of you just for fun?
						That's the same type of feeling that we are trying to express to our customers.
						With our fair pricing based on the location, timing, amount of people, and inclusion of pets, we can make sure that you keep coming back for more sessions for years to come. 
						If you have any questions about our pricing or how to reserve a session with us, please click on the Contact Us button in the upper right portion of the page.
